Gender Inequality - The Hard Truth

What do people in different countries actually think about gender inequality issues? Is this correlatable to things like level of education or type of politics for that country?

Sadly I never managed to finish this visualization. Therefore, the colors presented in the map is just arbitrary filler data. Likewise, the buttons and slider doesn't do anything.
