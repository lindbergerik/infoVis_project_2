        <h1>Gender Inequality - The Hard Truth</h1>
        <p>What do people in different countries actually think about gender inequality issues? Is this correlatable to things like level of education or type of politics for that country?</p>

        <p style="color:red;">Note: Sadly I never managed to finish this visualization. Therefore, the colors presented in the map is just arbitrary filler data. Likewise, the buttons and slider doesn't do anything.</p>

        <h1>Project 2 - Analytic Trail</h1>
        <p>I chose to focus on gender inequality as my research theme for this visualization. Going through VVS I found these 5 sets of [Agree - Disagree] questions that I think gives quite a detailed look into the thoughts about gender inequality in a country.</p>
        <img src="img/img_01.png"><img src="img/img_02.png">
        <p>To more easily understand the data at hand during the analysis I used google charts for some simple visualizations, for example:</p>
        <img src="img/img_03.png"><img src="img/img_04.png">
        <p>I found very varied data among the countries. Both with strong support and opposition to specific questions about gender inequality.

        To get a more nuanced view of the matter, I chose 3 other variables concerning more general questions of a country.</p>
        <img src="img/img_05.png">
        <p>For example:</p>
        <img src="img/img_06.png">
        <p>From this I began to approach some interesting statistics that I wanted to visualize. Therefore I set out to create a visualization that could show a user these 5 variables, cross-compared to the 3 general variables, on a world map concerning all these countries and over a span of 20 years.</p>

        <h1>Continuation</h1>
        <p>Sadly I never had time to finish this, but the plan was as follows:</p>
        <ul>Set up a index/javascript shell for a website and learn how to use D3.js - <span class="span1">DONE</span></ul>
        <ul>Implement the <a href="http://datamaps.github.io/">D3 Datamaps</a> library correctly to create an interactive worldmap - <span class="span1">DONE</span></ul>
        <ul>Export the VVS data and convert it into .csv-files - <span class="span1">DONE</span></ul>
        <ul>Read the .csv-files using javascript and utilize the datamaps library to create an auto-calculated color map of the world. As well as repurpousing the datamap to work with the [Agree - Disagree] format, instead of the [0% - 100%] format - <span class="span2">IN PROCESS</span></ul>
        <ul>Add interactivity by creating a UI which would let the user switch between different variables and years - <span class="span3">NOT DONE</span></ul>
